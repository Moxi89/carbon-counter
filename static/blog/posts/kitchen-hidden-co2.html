                    <section id="intro">
                        <p>The kitchen in my old apartment was driving me crazy. Everything seemed to need power all the time. After talking with neighbors and trying different setups, I found some eye-opening ways to cut back on energy use. No fancy gadgets needed - just simple switches that actually work.</p>
                    </section>

                        <h2>The Midnight Power Drain</h2>
                        <p>Ever walked into your kitchen at night? Those tiny lights everywhere - the microwave clock, the oven display, the coffee maker standby light - they're all drinking power 24/7. My neighbor calls them "vampire devices." Sounds dramatic, but she's right.</p>
                        <div class="quick-tip">
                            <h3>Quick Fix:</h3>
                            <p>I got a power strip for my coffee maker and toaster. One switch, everything off. For things that need constant power like the fridge, I learned a neat trick: keep it full (even water bottles work) - it runs less often that way.</p>
                        </div>

                    <section id="oven-tips">
                        <h2>The Oven Situation</h2>
                        <p>Here's something I didn't know: opening the oven door drops the temperature by about 25°C (75°F). When you're cooking, that means the oven works extra hard to heat up again. My grandmother never opens the oven when baking - now I know why.</p>
                        <div class="try-this">
                            <h3>Try This:</h3>
                            <p>Use the oven light instead of opening the door. If you're baking something like bread or cookies, try baking several things at once. More efficient, plus your kitchen smells amazing.</p>

                        <h2>Fridge Facts That Changed My Mind</h2>
                        <p>Remember how we used to stand with the fridge door open, thinking about what to eat? Turns out that's one of the biggest energy wasters in the kitchen. But the real surprise was learning about fridge placement.</p>
                        <div class="tips-list">
                            <h3>What Worked For Me:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Moved the fridge 10cm (4 inches) from the wall - it runs better with airflow</li>
                                <li>Started keeping a list of what's inside on the door</li>
                                <li>Clean the coils every few months (they're usually behind or under the fridge)</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h2>The Kettle Trick</h2>
                        <p>This one's so simple it's almost funny. I used to fill the kettle all the way up for one cup of tea. That's like heating three times more water than needed. Now I just fill it for what I need.</p>
                        <div class="tips-list">
                            <h3>Small Changes, Big Difference:</h3>

                                <li>Only boil what you need</li>
                                <li>Descale regularly (limescale makes your kettle work harder)</li>
                                <li>Use hot water right away - reheating wastes power</li>

                        <h2>Cool Cooking Tips</h2>
                        <p>Did you know pasta keeps cooking in hot water even with the heat off? Turn off the stove a few minutes early and let it finish cooking with the lid on. Works for vegetables too.</p>

                                <li>Match pot size to burner size</li>
                                <li>Defrost food in the fridge overnight instead of the microwave</li>

                        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                        <p>After trying these changes for a month, I noticed two things: my kitchen felt more organized, and my energy use dropped. The Carbon Counter showed the difference - about 15% less CO₂ from my kitchen alone.</p>

                            <h3>Your Turn</h3>
                            <p>Start with one thing. Maybe it's the power strip idea, or the kettle trick. Try it for a week and see what works in your kitchen. Small changes add up, and you might find your own clever ways to cut CO₂.</p>
