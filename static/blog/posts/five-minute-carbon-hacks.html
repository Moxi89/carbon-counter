                <p class="lead">"I don't have time for sustainability." I used to say this every morning as I rushed to work. Then I discovered these 5-minute hacks that cut my carbon footprint – and actually saved me time.</p>

                <!-- Personal connection/story -->
                <p>Between meetings, deadlines, and family commitments, finding time for eco-friendly habits seemed impossible. But after tracking my daily routines, I realized something surprising: some of my most time-consuming habits were also the most carbon-intensive.</p>

                <!-- Main problem statement -->
                <h2>The Busy Person's Climate Dilemma</h2>
                <p>Here's the reality: most of us want to reduce our carbon footprint, but we're already stretched thin. The secret isn't adding new tasks to your day – it's making your existing routines more efficient and eco-friendly at the same time.</p>

                <h2>5 Time-Saving Carbon Hacks</h2>

                <h3>1. The Morning Rush Revolution</h3>
                <p>My coffee routine was wasting both time and energy. Switching to a French press not only cut 3 minutes from my morning – it also saves 0.5 kWh per day compared to my old coffee maker. That's 45 kg of CO₂ per year!</p>

                <div class="try-this-box">
                    <h4>Try This</h4>
                    <p>Place your French press and kettle next to each other the night before. While the water boils, you can get dressed – no more waiting around.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>2. The 2-Minute Shower Hack</h3>
                <p>I discovered that pre-heating the bathroom while I brush my teeth means I need less hot water in the shower. This simple timing switch saves both water heating energy and precious morning minutes.</p>

                <h3>3. The Lunch Break Power-Down</h3>
                <p>Created a one-switch solution for my desk: all non-essential devices plug into one power strip. Flipping it when I leave for lunch saves more energy than individual standby modes – and there's no forgetting to turn things off.</p>

                <h3>4. The Commute Combo</h3>
                <p>Combining my workout with my commute by biking to work twice a week saves 30 minutes of gym time and cuts 8 kg of CO₂ emissions per week. Plus, I arrive more energized than after my old car commute.</p>

                <h3>5. The Evening Auto-Pilot</h3>
                <p>Setting up "sunset routines" on my smart devices means lights and heating automatically adjust in the evening. No more walking around the house checking everything – saving time and preventing energy waste from forgotten lights.</p>
